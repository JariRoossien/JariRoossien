## Hi there 👋

I'm Jari, a final year computer science student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and avid formula 1 fan 🏎️.

## Projects
#### BoodschappenWijzer
An upcoming application that scrapes dutch supermarket stores, and compares the prices to determine which store is the cheapest to purchase your groceries at.
#### TRS Bot 
My own Discord bot written in Java using JDA (Java Discord API). I mainly implement random features in here that are fun to use, such as games like Yahtzee & Tic Tac Toe, a wikipedia lookup and random page displayer, or  using it to host a World Cup Prediction tournament!
#### TRS Smp Bridge
A small bridge plugin between Discord and Minecraft, allowing a 2-way communication channel, and some server management tools such as whitelisting done through Discord.
